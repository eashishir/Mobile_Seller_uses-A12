➼About Website :
## Eftekhar it;s me , i am a product/object photographer based in dhaka, bangladesh. my photography is clean-cut and top-of-the-line quality, as apparent from my minimal photography portfolio website.

## ➼Inspired BY clients,they say that:
 The professional photographer showcases his best photos with plenty of negative space on the homepage. You can find more about each photography project by clicking on the associated photo: He mentions his roles in the project, what he did to successfully complete the project, about the client, and more for each photo. It’s a lot of (well-written) text, but it follows the “show and then tell” principle I discussed in the intro.

## Besides showcasing his work on the homepage, he has a separate Work page where he has displayed more of his works beautifully in a two-column layout.

➼Is it helpful for everyone?:
## Photography is important because it allows people to see the world from different perspectives. Thanks to photography, you can admire the most diverse scenarios and situations captured in a frozen moment. Photography is so powerful that it enables you to bring meaningful experiences to others in the form of static images. It allows the diffusion of information about things as they are.
